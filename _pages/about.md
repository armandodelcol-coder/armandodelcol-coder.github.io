## Career Deatils
I started to interest in programming since about 2015 when i was studying in a course to be machining mechanic and i've learned to use CNC (computer numeric control) machine so i was really interested in programming part rather than mechanic part so i started to search where this type of skill might be used, and i discovered the software developer world. I started studying programming with javascript in 2016, started a degree course of analysis and development of systems and got my first job in the field in 2017 at a company which produces software for accounting offices, i worked for this company for 1 year and 6 months. After that, i continue to study more, i got other jobs experiences as web backend developer. I consider myself a flexible professional, i've learned always quickly the  new busines rules and new tech tools. Today i'm in Sênior Backend Developer position.
